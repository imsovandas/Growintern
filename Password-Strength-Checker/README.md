I'm thrilled to announce the development of a Password Strength Checker project, designed to create a password-strength testing tool. This tool aims to analyze factors like length, complexity, and inclusion of special characters to accurately determine the strength level of passwords.

I'm grateful to Growintern for providing me with the opportunity to work on such a meaningful project and expand my skills in cybersecurity.
